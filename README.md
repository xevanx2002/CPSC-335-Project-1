## How to Execute the Programs
The two programs are created in differing languages, algorithm 1 in Python and algorithm 2 in C++. For algorithm 1, make sure that you have Python installed; if not, refer to https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ for the install process. After verifying it works, open a cmd or PowerShell terminal within the same folder as the algo1.py file. Once there, run the command "python algo1.py" in the terminal, and you will be prompted with the inputs for the algorithm. The proper formatting for inputs follows as such: the integer for the number of coordinates and "[(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 2), (4, 6)]" for the loop detection. The program will ask Input: (number), then enter/return and the proper format for coordinates. The coordinates must include the proper syntax and spacing, and all must be entered at once for execution. For algorithm 2, run the submitted algo2.exe file that has been provided. This will execute the program within a created terminal, promting the user to input the necesary data for the program to execute the necesary steps and solve the problem. After solving the problem, the program will ask the user if they wish to start again and will loop back to the beginning of the program.
